## 2026-09-25 · Groundwork: `check:anims`

This repository starts from the 1.0.2 import, which predates the plan. PLAN.md marks 1.1 (eyes follow the cursor) as done and 1.2 (drag and drop) as in progress, but that work isn't in this repository, and neither is the `check:anims` script the ground rules rely on. All three are rebuilt here.

**`npm run check:anims`** (`scripts/check-anims.mjs`) loads the engine through Vite's SSR loader, so it needs no extra dependencies. It samples every animation at 60 fps: one play, two more loops (to cover the loop seam), and the fade-out after a play-once ends. For each sample it records the sprite (frame, offset, scale, opacity), the particles, the quantized energy and glow of all 620 cells, and, for Guitar Jam, the pressed-flash overlays. The idle pose is checked too, with and without blinking. Samples are hashed in quarter-second chunks, so a change is reported as "DIFFERENT from 1.50 s". Changing one pulse's strength by 0.01 is caught.

To make the check cover what is actually drawn, the renderer's frame composition moved into a pure engine module, **`src/engine/frame.ts`**. `playFrame(anim, t)` handles the loop section and pulses carried across the loop seam, and `lingerFrame(anim, end, after)` handles pulses fading out after a play. The renderer now calls these instead of its own copy.

Verified:
- `check:anims` snapshot taken from the unchanged engine; `same` for all 8 entries after the move.
- Renderer-level check in Chromium: every animation rendered in controlled mode at 30 fps through a play and two loops (2,285 frames), hashing all three canvases and the flash overlays, before and after the refactor. All frames were identical.
- `tsc`, `build:ext` and `build:desktop` pass.
